Write a React component from scratch:
          class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
    }
      render(){
        return(
            <div>

            <h1>My First React Component!</h1>
            
            </div>

        );
      }
};

  ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById("challenge-node"));
  
  React interview questions: 
  1. What is JSX?
     A. JavaScript in XML, syntactic sugar for React elements
      
 2. Why is class className?
     A. class is a reserved JavaScript keyword but babel transpiles it
     
 3. Describe dataflow in React?
     A. Unidirectional. every component has a parent/child relationship. info is being passed down using props, states, etc.
     
 4. How would you delay an API call until a component has mounted?
     A. 1. componentDidMount() 2. use effect hook and pass an array.
     
     
 5. Should you use ternary or && operator to render react components?
     A. Use Ternaries. && operator has issues like if length of something && something is 0, it is a falsey, rendors 0.
